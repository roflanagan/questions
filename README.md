## Accompanying Files for ``The Mathematics of Questions''

This repository contains code that verifies important results in the main paper, as well as the code that generates the figures.

Each figure is generated by a separate script, apart from figures 7.3 and 7.4, which are both generated by fig7.3_7.4.py.

The Jupyter notebook, questions.ipynb, contains code that verifies results and reproduces some of the figures. A pdf version of the notebook is also provided.
